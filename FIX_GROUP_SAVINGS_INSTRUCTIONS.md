# Fix Group Savings Update Issue

This guide provides instructions on how to fix the "failed to update group savings, please try again later" error.

## Option 1: Run the Fix Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to fix the issue is to run the provided script:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system
2. Ensure your `.env` file contains the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   ```
3. Run the fix script:
   ```
   node scripts/fix-group-savings.js
   ```
4. The script will apply the necessary SQL changes to fix the issue
5. Try updating group savings again

## Option 2: Run the SQL Manually in Supabase

If the script doesn't work, you can run the SQL manually:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com/
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to the SQL Editor (left sidebar)
4. Create a new query
5. Copy and paste the following SQL:

```sql
-- Allow admins to insert into group_savings
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Admins can insert group savings"
  ON public.group_savings
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true
    )
  );

-- Allow admins to delete from group_savings (if needed)
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Admins can delete group savings"
  ON public.group_savings
  FOR DELETE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true
    )
  );

-- Update the update_group_savings function to handle errors better
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_group_savings(amount_to_add NUMERIC)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
  success BOOLEAN := FALSE;
BEGIN
  -- Check if the user is an admin
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND is_admin = true
  ) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Only admins can update group savings';
  END IF;

  -- Update the group savings
  UPDATE public.group_savings
  SET 
    total_amount = total_amount + amount_to_add,
    last_updated_at = NOW(),
    updated_by = auth.uid()
  WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM public.group_savings ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1);

  -- Check if the update was successful
  IF FOUND THEN
    success := TRUE;
  END IF;

  RETURN success;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE WARNING 'Error updating group savings: %', SQLERRM;
    RETURN FALSE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

6. Run the query
7. Try updating group savings again

## What This Fix Does

The fix addresses several issues that could cause the "failed to update group savings" error:

1. **Missing RLS Policies**: Adds Row Level Security (RLS) policies to allow admins to insert and delete records in the `group_savings` table.

2. **Improved Error Handling**: Updates the `update_group_savings` function to provide better error messages and return a boolean indicating success or failure.

3. **Admin Check**: Ensures that only admins can update group savings by checking the user's admin status.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after applying the fix:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify that your user account has admin privileges
3. Make sure you're properly authenticated
4. Try clearing your browser cache and logging in again

### Common Issues and Solutions
