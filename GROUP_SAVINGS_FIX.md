## Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Apply the Database Fixes

The issue is caused by missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies and inadequate error handling in the database. You need to apply the following fixes:

#### Option A: Run the Fix Script (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Ensure your `.env` file contains the Supabase credentials
3. Run the fix script:
   ```
   npm run fix:group-savings
   ```

#### Option B: Run the SQL Manually

If the script doesn't work, you can run the SQL manually in the Supabase dashboard:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the SQL from `supabase/migrations/20240901000000_fix_group_savings_policies.sql`
5. Run the query

### Step 2: Test the Fix

You can test if the fix worked by running:

```
npm run test:group-savings
```

This script will:
1. Fetch the current group savings
2. Try to update it by adding 100 to the total amount
3. Fetch the updated group savings
4. Check if the update was successful

### Step 3: Try in the App

After applying the fix, try updating group savings in the app:

1. Log in as an admin
2. Go to the Admin Payments page
3. Click "Update Savings"
4. Enter a new amount
5. Click "Update Savings"
